- 👋 Hi, I’m @DIKUWCode
- 👀 I’m interested in sharpening my skills. Maybe start with an iOS App?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google Web Dev (Odin), Script and Swift.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an App to deploy for an overly complicated Golf Side Game called Wolfhammer.
- 📫 How to reach me john@ Dikuw. Charlie Alpha or speak in a loud clear voice to any parliament of owls, either way our team will get the message.
